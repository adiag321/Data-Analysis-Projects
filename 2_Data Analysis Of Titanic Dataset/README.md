# Data-Analysis-Of-Titanic-Dataset
 This Repository contains the basic operations on Titanic Dataset
 
Dataset Overview:

The data has been split into two groups:
1. Training set (train.csv)
The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.

2. Test set (test.csv)
The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

3. Gender_submission.csv
It contains a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.

Data Defination:

* survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* pclass: For	Ticket class	(1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower)
* sex
* Age	
* sibsp: Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
* parch: Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
* ticket:	Ticket number	
* fare:	Passenger fare	
* cabin:	Cabin number	
* embarked:	Port of Embarkation	(C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
